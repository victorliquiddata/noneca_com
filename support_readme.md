Based on the **README** and the **implemented prototype codebase**, here‚Äôs a summary of the current status and a proposal for the **next development step**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Completed So Far**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Strategic Foundation

* **Project Goals**: Clear business and technical objectives defined.
* **Architecture**: Modular ETL pipeline, SQLite, Dash dashboard, OAuth2 flow, scalable design.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Implemented Code

* **Authentication & API Client**:

  * Complete and robust `MLClient` class for interacting with Mercado Livre API.
  * Full suite of endpoints covered (users, items, reviews, questions, orders, etc.).
  * Token management (refresh, save/load, fallback) is production-grade.
  * Rate limiting and error handling implemented.

* **Testing**:

  * 13/14 tests pass. The skipped test is justifiably excluded due to an upstream metadata issue.
  * Integration and error-handling tests in place.
  * Excellent unit test coverage with a reusable test harness.

---

## üìç **Current Gaps**

According to both documents:

* No ETL orchestration or data loading logic exists yet (transformers/loaders/services/dash are scaffolded only).
* SQLite schema is defined but not populated with data.
* No competitor or trend data is processed yet.
* Dashboard components and visualizations are not started.

---

## üß≠ **Next Development Step: Build Initial ETL Flow**

### üéØ Goal: Ingest real Mercado Livre data into the SQLite database

---

## üîß **Recommended Next Module: ETL Ingestion (Phase 2 Start)**

### Implement: `items_extractor.py` ‚Üí `product_enricher.py` ‚Üí `data_loader.py`

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. ### **Create Extractor**: `items_extractor.py`

   * Inputs: access token, seller ID or query keyword
   * Uses: `MLClient.get_items`, `get_item`, `get_desc`, `get_reviews`, `get_questions`
   * Output: raw product dictionary list

2. ### **Create Transformer**: `product_enricher.py`

   * Normalize/enrich raw items:

     * Flatten nested JSON fields
     * Compute `conversion_rate`, `discount_percentage`
     * Extract brand, size, color, gender from attributes

3. ### **Create Loader**: `data_loader.py`

   * Inserts enriched items into:

     * `items`
     * `sellers` (if seller info available)
     * `price_history` (with timestamp)
   * Ensure upsert logic to avoid duplicates

4. ### **Wire Up in `main.py`**

   * Run initial ingest for a known seller/category
   * Schedule hourly with APScheduler (already planned)

5. ### **Bonus (Optional)**

   * Integrate `market_trends` data using `MLClient.get_trends`
   * Add one transformer + loader for `market_trends`

---

## üìä Milestone Outcome

Once this ETL step is done:

* SQLite DB will have real Mercado Livre products for analysis.
* You'll be ready to begin **dashboard visualizations** and **competitive analysis**.

I‚Äôve implemented both modules in a single file for clarity. They are separated by header comments so you can split them into `items_extractor.py` and `product_enricher.py` as needed.

```python
# items_extractor.py
import logging
from src.extractors.ml_api_client import create_client

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def extract_items(seller_id, limit=50):
    client, token = create_client()
    try:
        items = client.get_items(token, seller_id, limit=limit)
        return items or []
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to extract items for seller {seller_id}: {e}")
        return []


# product_enricher.py
from datetime import datetime


def _get_attr(attrs, key):
    for a in attrs or []:
        if a.get("id") == key:
            return a.get("value_name") or a.get("value_id")
    return None


def enrich_items(raw_items):
    enriched = []
    for item in raw_items:
        attrs = item.get("attributes", [])
        brand = _get_attr(attrs, "BRAND")
        size = _get_attr(attrs, "SIZE")
        color = _get_attr(attrs, "COLOR")
        gender = _get_attr(attrs, "GENDER")

        views = item.get("views", 0) or 0
        sold = item.get("sold_quantity", 0) or 0
        conversion = round(sold / views, 4) if views else 0.0

        current_price = item.get("price") or 0.0
        original_price = item.get("original_price") or current_price
        discount_pct = (
            round((original_price - current_price) / original_price * 100, 2)
            if original_price
            else 0.0
        )

        enriched.append({
            "item_id": item.get("id"),
            "title": item.get("title"),
            "category_id": item.get("category_id"),
            "current_price": current_price,
            "original_price": original_price,
            "available_quantity": item.get("available_quantity"),
            "sold_quantity": sold,
            "condition": item.get("condition"),
            "brand": brand,
            "size": size,
            "color": color,
            "gender": gender,
            "views": views,
            "conversion_rate": conversion,
            "seller_id": item.get("seller_id"),
            "created_at": datetime.utcnow(),
            "updated_at": datetime.utcnow(),
            "discount_percentage": discount_pct,
        })
    return enriched
```

* **`extract_items(seller_id, limit)`**:

  * Uses the existing `MLClient` to fetch a list of raw item dictionaries.
  * Returns an empty list and logs an error if anything goes wrong.

* **`enrich_items(raw_items)`**:

  * Pulls out `brand`, `size`, `color`, and `gender` from each item‚Äôs `attributes` list (if present).
  * Calculates `conversion_rate` = sold / views (defaulting to 0 if `views` is 0).
  * Sets `original_price` to the API‚Äôs `original_price` field if available, else falls back to `price`.
  * Computes a simple `discount_percentage` whenever `original_price` > 0.
  * Populates timestamps for `created_at` and `updated_at`.
  * Returns a list of flat dictionaries ready to insert into your `items` table (and/or use for downstream BI logic).

Feel free to split the two sections into separate files (`items_extractor.py` and `product_enricher.py`) in your `src/extractors` and `src/transformers` folders, respectively.
---
At this point, you have two new modules:

1. **`extract_items()`** (in `items_extractor.py`), which pulls raw item data from Mercado Livre.
2. **`enrich_items()`** (in `product_enricher.py`), which normalizes and computes a few extra fields.

Your ‚Äúnext step‚Äù actually involves both testing and further development‚Äîideally in this order:

---

## 1. Write Basic Unit Tests for the Two New Functions

Before you build any loader or dashboard logic, you want to be confident that:

* **`extract_items(seller_id)`** really returns a list of valid item dicts (or an empty list).
* **`enrich_items(raw_items)`** correctly flattens each item, fills in defaults and calculates rates/discounts.

### Suggested Test Cases

* **`extract_items()`**:

  * Mock a fake `MLClient` that returns a known payload (e.g. two minimal item dicts), and assert that `extract_items` returns exactly that list.
  * Mock a client exception and confirm that `extract_items(...)` returns `[]` without throwing.

* **`enrich_items()`**:

  * Pass in a minimal ‚Äúraw‚Äù dict:

    ```python
    raw_items = [{
      "id": "ABC123",
      "title": "Test Product",
      "category_id": "XYZ",
      "price": 50.0,
      "original_price": 100.0,
      "available_quantity": 10,
      "sold_quantity": 5,
      "condition": "new",
      "attributes": [
        {"id": "BRAND", "value_name": "MyBrand"},
        {"id": "SIZE", "value_name": "M"},
      ],
      "views": 100,
      "seller_id": 999,
    }]
    ```
  * Confirm that:

    * `brand == "MyBrand"`, `size == "M"`.
    * `conversion_rate == 0.05` (5/100).
    * `discount_percentage == 50.0` ((100‚Äì50)/100\*100).
    * All required keys exist in the returned dict.
  * Pass in an item with zero `views` and confirm `conversion_rate == 0.0`.
  * Pass in an item with missing `original_price` field and confirm `original_price` falls back to `price` and `discount_percentage == 0.0`.

Putting these tests in something like `tests/test_extract_enrich.py` will catch regressions if the Mercado Livre payload shape changes slightly later.

---

## 2. Implement & Test a Basic Loader

Once your extractor/enricher are rock-solid, you can wire up a ‚Äúloader‚Äù that pushes these enriched records into your SQLite schema. Suggested approach:

1. **Create `data_loader.py`** (in `src/loaders/`) that:

   * Accepts a list of enriched dicts.
   * Opens a SQLAlchemy session (or plain `sqlite3` connection) to your `items` and `price_history` tables.
   * Performs an upsert (insert or update) on each item:

     * Check if `item_id` already exists in `items`. If so, update `current_price`, `sold_quantity`, `views`, etc.; otherwise insert a new row.
   * Writes a new record into `price_history` with the current timestamp and `current_price`, `discount_percentage`, etc.

2. **Write unit tests for `data_loader.py`**:

   * Use a temporary in-memory SQLite (e.g. `sqlite:///:memory:`) so you don‚Äôt clobber your real DB.
   * Verify that when you call `data_loader.insert_items(enriched_list)`:

     * The `items` table ends up with the correct number of rows.
     * A second call with the same item but updated price actually updates the existing row (not create a duplicate) and adds a new row to `price_history`.
   * Test edge cases (e.g. missing required fields, invalid data types) so your loader fails gracefully or raises clear errors.

---

## 3. Hook Up a Simple ETL Script / Scheduler

After you have:

* **Extractor & Enricher** working and tested.
* **Loader** working and tested.

You can create a simple ETL entry-point in your `main.py` or a new `etl.py`:

```python
from src.extractors.items_extractor import extract_items
from src.transformers.product_enricher import enrich_items
from src.loaders.data_loader import load_items_to_db

def run_full_etl(seller_id, limit=50):
    raw = extract_items(seller_id, limit=limit)
    if not raw:
        print("No items extracted; skipping load step.")
        return

    enriched = enrich_items(raw)
    load_items_to_db(enriched)
    print(f"Processed {len(enriched)} items for seller {seller_id}.")
```

Then wire that into APScheduler (in, say, `main.py` or a dedicated scheduler module) to run once an hour for your target seller(s). Test that scheduling logic too (e.g. schedule just once, confirm it runs successfully).

---

## 4. Light Smoke Test of the End-to-End ETL Job

Finally, do a smoke test against your actual Mercado Livre account:

1. **Run `run_full_etl(...)` manually** for your known seller ID and check:

   * The `items` table is populated or updated.
   * `price_history` has a new row for each item.
2. **Inspect data** (e.g. with a simple SELECT query) to confirm fields are correct.

If it looks good, you can commit your changes, then let the scheduler run a full cycle and check logs/DB again.

---

### Summary

* **Step 1 (Testing)**: Unit-test your two new functions to catch any edge cases in attribute lookups and math calculations.
* **Step 2 (Development)**: Build and test a data loader that upserts into `items` and writes to `price_history`.
* **Step 3 (Integration)**: Connect extractor ‚Üí enricher ‚Üí loader in a single ETL job, then schedule it.

That workflow ensures you‚Äôre always verifying each piece before you move on. Once all tests pass and ETL is running smoothly, you‚Äôll be in great shape to start building BI services and dashboard components.
